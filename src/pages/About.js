                    <p>School and self study has influenced my ever growing set of skills; This includes full stack development knowledge through languages ranging through HTML/CSS/JS, Java, C++, C# or whatever else I decide to pick up.</p>

                    <p>Having an interest in videogames since childhood, it was obvious that I would end up picking up game development as a hobby. When I am not working on regular projects, youâ€™ll typically find me working on game ideas in Unity, taking online courses, or shoving my head into a book on game design.</p>
